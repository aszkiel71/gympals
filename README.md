# gympals
Basic python app. Workout app made by me and my friend (DeVillian1993). 2 weeks project during holidays.

The application allows you to log in, register, add information about yourself (age, weight, height, body circumferences). An additional option is to add your workouts (there is a database of exercises), where you fill in the duration of the workout, how many series you did, repetitions, at what weight on a particular exercise. Then you can save your workout and check it later on the screen.
